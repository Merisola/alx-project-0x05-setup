# 🧠 Image Generation App – Application of State

Welcome to **Project 0x08** of the ALX Frontend Advanced curriculum!

This project builds upon [alx-project-0x07](https://github.com/your-username/alx-project-0x07) and introduces **state management** using React Hooks. The app now tracks user prompts, loading status, and allows displaying generated images dynamically using reusable components and TypeScript interfaces.
